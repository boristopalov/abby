# Abby - AI Music Production Assistant ðŸŽ¹

Abby is an assistant for music producers using Ableton Live. Abby can listen to your music, provide feedback, and suggest improvements to your production.

This project started as a fork of [https://github.com/vroomai/live](https://github.com/vroomai/live).

## Notes

Abby is under active development. There are bugs.

## Features

- **Automatic Tracking**: Abby keeps track of any changes you make, like tweaking device parameters
- **Chat Interface**: Chat with Abby about your music and ask for suggestions
- **Listens with you**: Abby hears what you hear in Ableton and can provide detailed feedback on mix, arrangement, and musical elements

## Usage

`cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
`cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && fastapi dev app/main.py`

The UI should be accessible at `localhost:5173`

## TODO

- [] Add more direct DAW integrations
