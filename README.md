## Summary

Vroom Live allows you to chat directly with your Ableton Live session. It has the ability to view your tracks, instruments and devices and modulate parameters. It works by creating an agent using GPT3.5 and tools that can communicate via OSC over WebSocket.

This repository was created as a submission to the [Timbre Tools Hackathon 2024](https://comma.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/timbre-tools-hackathon/).
